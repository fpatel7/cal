# Simple Calculator Application

the four most common arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on our calculator app by constructing a valid expression using the input buttons, and have the result displayed on the screen. ![Screenshot (184)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79761974/109454231-6019b280-7a19-11eb-8c23-bd0b72019837.png)

Result text box  holds a string value that represents the input of the user or the result of an operation. The operator key will store the operator for an expression. Its initial value is also null. firstNumber will store the first operand for any expression. It’s set to null for now. secondNumber essentially serves as a way to check if both the first and the operator have been inputted. If it’s true, then result will show. Click the button such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I create a function for this purpose so that anytime an operation is performed,  can always invoke it to update the screen with every click the contents of Result.
